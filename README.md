# ShardsOfAbraxas

The Shards of Abraxas project is meant to serve as a demonstration of my current programming abilities in C# and Unity. Focus is placed on proper higher-level
architecture practices and documentation and a push for legibility and scalability expected from a Senior Developer position. The project is a one-man development
effort and the focus is on coding functionality over visual effects, meaning the game's mechanics should work effectively, but the game itself is a bit ugly to look
at currently.

Shards of Abraxas is a multiplayer competitive card game utilizing the NetCode multiplayer Unity package. More details on the game including the game design document
will be added as more functionality is added to this repository.
